Hello and welcome to my github repository!

In this repository you can download an XR assembly instruction for iOS devices. You will also receive installation instructions and a short operating manual as a PDF file. 
You can also download the used ImageTargets (Markers) used and a demonstration video.

The software development was part of the AirKon research project and was developed as part of my master's thesis.
